With our growing reliance on the Internet, we are forced to make account after account, whether it be for e-mail, online shopping, applications, or other services. Inevitably, we lose count of the overwhelming number of accounts we sign up for.

This growing reliance on the creation of Internet accounts that hold our information leads to two main problems:
1. Several services have different requirements for logging on. For example, password lengths may differ for different logins, or some may require certain symbols are inserted to increase site security. This variety leads to the need to create multiple passwords, which can be very difficult for one to remember.
2. On the other hand, by using the same password over and over again, users put themselves at risk. If a person is unfortunate enough to have their password leaked, and they happen to use that same password for other services, an attacker can access a much larger array of information about the user.

So the solution we are looking for is some way to remember 100 different passwords. Unfortunately, most humans are not capable of that, but maybe a computer can.

MemoPass attempts to solve this problem. MemoPass will allow a user to store a database of their passwords and other login information for all their accounts, which can be easily accessed with a few clicks and button presses. When a password is accessed, rather than be displayed onto the screen, <b>it will instead be copied onto the computer's clipboard, allowing one to simply paste the password into the box without having to take the extra time to type it out.</b>

Here are some of the basic functions of MemoPass:
1. Stores a database of login information including usernames, passwords, and security questions, which can be accessed simply by giving the name of the site.
2. Keep passwords hidden from others looking at your screen by copying them to your clipboard instead. Also has a cleaning functionality that cleans the password from the clipboard so you don't accidentally paste it into plain site.
3. Generate randomized passwords for sites that are difficult to brute force.
4. Passwords stored encrypted on one's own system.
5. Easy to use UI

<u>NOTICE:</u> The encryption algorithms are still being developed, so passwords may not be stored in the most secure way. In order to ensure maximum security, never share access of the program to anyone else.
